Stgen
-
Code generation library which can be used for generating stubs for obfuscating code (for ex. by ioncube).

Stubs can be generated by using stgen utility:

    stgen generate:stub <source code path> <destination file> --namespace=Base\Namespace

Also generator can be configured through the code:
```php
    $generator = new CodeGenerator(
        new ReflectionStubGenerateStrategy(),
        new PSR4ClassSource('source path', 'Base\\Namespace')
    );
    $output->writeln($generator->generate());
```

### TODO ###
  - make runner for isolated running the source generators
